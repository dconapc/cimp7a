/*

Assigment 14: Program prompts user for an integer. The program continue to
prompt the user for integers one at a time until the user enters a zero. The
program keeps track of the number of integers other than zero that are input. It
keeps track of the number of positive integers, the number of negative integers,
the total of the integers entered. And calculates the average of the integers
input with a long variable type. 

*@input: Any integer. If the user enters a zero, the program ends.

*@logic: Program uses a while loop to repeat the task of prompting the user
to enter an integer. When the user enters a zero the while loop evaluates to
false and ends. A count variable adds one for each interation of the loop. An if
else statement evaluated if the integer is positive or negative and count the 
how many positive versus negative values are input. Then average is calculated 
with a long varirable type. 

*@output: The output of the program is the number of positive integers, the
number of negative integers, the total of the integers entered. And the average
of the integers with a long variable type. 

"No numbers were entered except 0\n".
