/*
Assigment 9: Program takes an initial value of $1000. Prompts user to enter
term and rate of loan. Calculates the future value of the investment based on 
the values entered by user. 

*@input: Interest rate of investment and term of investment both stored as
doubles.

*@logic: Program uses values entered by user and the following equation to 
calculate the final value of the investment:
PV * Math.pow( (1.0+rate/1200.0), term ).

*@output: Formantted out put of "An initial investment of $%.2f after %.0f 
months at annual rate %.2f%% is $%.2f", PV, term, rate, fv ). Two decimals for 
the Principle, no zeros for the term, two decimals for the interst rate and 
final value respectively.
