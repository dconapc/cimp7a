/*
Assigment 10: Program prompts user to enter to x and y coordinates. Then 
calculated the distance between the two points.
*@input: Two x and y coordinates as doubles. 
*@logic: Program calculates the distance between to points using the 
distance formula: distance = squareRoot( (x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2) );
*@output: Outputs the distance between the two points calculating using doublers
and printing the answer as a double with precision of two decimal points as 
follows: "The distance between the two points is 3.00"
