/*
Assigment 13: Program prompts user for an integer. The program continue to 
prompt the user for integers one at a time until the user enters a zero. The
number of integers entered is ouput after the user enters zero.
*@input: Any integer. If the user enters a zero, the program ends.
*@logic: Program uses a while loop to repeat the task of prompting the user
to enter an integer. When the user enters a zero the while loop evaluates to
false and ends. A count variable adds one for each interation of the loop.
*@output: The output of the program is the number of integers enter or the 
value of the count variable which adds one for each iteration of the while loop.
If the user enters zero for the firs integer the output is: 
"No numbers were entered except 0\n".
