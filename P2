/*
Assigment 4. Program reads in two integers and outputs the sum, product, and 
quotient. 


@input: input two integers.
@logic: program takes two integers and prints out the sum, product, and quotient.
the output of the quotient must be cast into a double, otherwise it will possbily output
a zero. Precision must be a float or double. 
@output: Output is the sum, quotient and product of the two integers in that order. 
In the form of "First Number +,*,divide Second Number = The Answer".
