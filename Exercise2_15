Assigment 11: Program prompts user to enter three points for a triangle. Then
outputs the area of the triangle with a formatted output.
*@input: Three x and y coordinates to form a triangle.
*@logic: Program calculate the area of a triangle using the distance formula
and Herons formula for calculating the area of a triangle with the length of the
three sides of the tirangle. 
*@output: Outputs the area of the triangle with a fomatted output using a
floating integer with a percision of 2 decimal points.
