/*
Assigment 16: Program reads in ten numbers, calculated the mean and standard
deviation, and then prints them out to standard output. 
*@input: Ten integers.
*@logic: Prgram reads ten numbers in and stores them in an array using a for
loop. Then mean is calculated with a method dividing the sum of the numbers
by the length of the array. The standard deviation is calculated with a method
using a for loop to calculate the summing portion of the equation. The
calculations are printed to the standard output with format specifier. 
*@output: The output of the program is the mean of the ten numbers and the
standard deviation0: "The mean is %,.2f\n", mean( data )\nThe standard deviation 
is %,.2f\n", std(data, average)"
